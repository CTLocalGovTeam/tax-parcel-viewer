# tax-parcel-viewer

The Tax Parcel Viewer is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a HTML 5 / JavaScript application that provides the general public and other interested parties local government property tax and assessment information and supplements that information with lifestyle and internet broadband information for a given neighborhood.  It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device.
